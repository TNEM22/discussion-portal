Both the container and the button have click event listeners. When you click the button, not only does the button's event fire, but the click \"bubbles\" up to trigger the container's event as well.","upvote":4}},"starred":false,"timestamp":1739860754292},"1739880442323":{"email":"abhi@mail.com","subject":"What is Json","question":"JSON working and usage.","responses":null,"starred":false,"timestamp":1739880442323}}
